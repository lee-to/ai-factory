# Verify — Post-Implementation Quality Check

Verify that the completed implementation matches the plan, nothing was missed, and the code is production-ready.

**This skill is optional** — invoked after `/aif-implement` finishes all tasks, or manually at any time.

---

## Step 0: Load Context

### 0.1 Find Plan File

Same logic as `/aif-implement`:

```
1. .ai-factory/PLAN.md exists? → Use it
2. No PLAN.md → Check current git branch:
   git branch --show-current
   → Look for .ai-factory/plans/<branch-name>.md
```

If no plan file found:
```
AskUserQuestion: No plan file found. What should I verify?

Options:
1. Verify last commit — Check the most recent commit for completeness
2. Verify branch diff — Compare current branch against main
3. Cancel
```

### 0.2 Read Plan & Tasks

- Read the plan file to understand what was supposed to be implemented
- `TaskList` → get all tasks and their statuses
- Read `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md` for project context (tech stack, conventions)

**Read `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-verify/SKILL.md`** — MANDATORY if the file exists.

This file contains project-specific rules accumulated by `/aif-evolve` from patches,
codebase conventions, and tech-stack analysis. These rules are tailored to the current project.

**How to apply skill-context rules:**
- Treat them as **project-level overrides** for this skill's general instructions
- When a skill-context rule conflicts with a general rule written in this SKILL.md,
  **the skill-context rule wins** (more specific context takes priority — same principle as nested CLAUDE.md files)
- When there is no conflict, apply both: general rules from SKILL.md + project rules from skill-context
- Do NOT ignore skill-context rules even if they seem to contradict this skill's defaults —
  they exist because the project's experience proved the default insufficient
- **CRITICAL:** skill-context rules apply to ALL outputs of this skill — including the Verification
  Report template. If a skill-context rule says "verification MUST check X" or "report MUST include
  section Y" — you MUST augment the report accordingly. Generating a verification that ignores
  skill-context rules is a bug.

**Enforcement:** After generating any output artifact, verify it against all skill-context rules.
If any rule is violated — fix the output before presenting it to the user.

### 0.3 Gather Changed Files

```bash
# All files changed during this feature/plan
git diff --name-only main...HEAD
# Or if on main, check recent commits
git diff --name-only HEAD~$(number_of_tasks)..HEAD
```

Store as `CHANGED_FILES`.

---

## Step 1: Task Completion Audit

Go through **every task** in the plan and verify it was actually implemented.

For each task:

### 1.1 Read Task Description

```
TaskGet(taskId) → Get full description, requirements, acceptance criteria
```

### 1.2 Verify Implementation Exists

For each requirement in the task description:
- Use `Glob` and `Grep` to find the code that implements it
- Read the relevant files to confirm the implementation is complete
- Check that the implementation matches what was described, not just that "something was written"

### 1.3 Build Checklist

For each task, produce a verification result:

```
✅ Task #1: Create user model — COMPLETE
   - User model created at src/models/user.ts
   - All fields present (id, email, name, createdAt, updatedAt)
   - Validation decorators added

⚠️ Task #3: Add password reset endpoint — PARTIAL
   - Endpoint created at src/api/auth/reset.ts
   - MISSING: Email sending logic (task mentioned SendGrid integration)
   - MISSING: Token expiration check

❌ Task #5: Add rate limiting — NOT FOUND
   - No rate limiting middleware detected
   - No rate-limit related packages in dependencies
```

Statuses:
- `✅ COMPLETE` — all requirements verified in code
- `⚠️ PARTIAL` — some requirements implemented, some missing
- `❌ NOT FOUND` — implementation not detected
- `⏭️ SKIPPED` — task was intentionally skipped by user during implement

---

## Step 2: Code Quality Verification

### 2.1 Build & Compile Check

Detect the build system and verify the project compiles:

| Detection | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| `go.mod` | `go build ./...` |
| `tsconfig.json` | `npx tsc --noEmit` |
| `package.json` with `build` script | `npm run build` (or pnpm/yarn/bun) |
| `pyproject.toml` | `python -m py_compile` on changed files |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo check` |
| `composer.json` | `composer validate` |

If build fails → report errors with file:line references.

### 2.2 Test Check

If the project has tests and they were part of the plan:

| Detection | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| `jest.config.*` or `vitest` | `npm test` |
| `pytest` | `pytest` |
| `go test` | `go test ./...` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo test` |

If tests fail → report which tests failed and whether they relate to the implemented tasks.

If no tests exist or testing was explicitly skipped in the plan → note it but don't fail.

### 2.3 Lint Check

If linters are configured:

| Detection | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| `eslint.config.*` / `.eslintrc*` | `npx eslint [changed files]` |
| `.golangci.yml` | `golangci-lint run ./...` |
| `ruff` in pyproject.toml | `ruff check [changed files]` |

Only lint the changed files to keep output focused.

### 2.4 Import & Dependency Check

- Verify no unused imports were left behind
- Check that new dependencies mentioned in tasks were actually added (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `composer.json`)
- Check for missing dependencies (imports that reference packages not in dependency files)

---

## Step 3: Consistency Checks

### 3.1 Plan vs Code Drift

Check for discrepancies between what the plan says and what was built:

- **Naming**: Do variable/function/endpoint names match what the plan specified?
- **File locations**: Are files where the plan said they should be?
- **API contracts**: Do endpoint paths, request/response shapes match the plan?

### 3.2 Leftover Artifacts

Search for things that should have been cleaned up:

```
Grep in CHANGED_FILES: TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX|TEMP|PLACEHOLDER|console\.log\(.*debug|print\(.*debug
```

Report any found — they might be intentional, but flag them.

### 3.3 Configuration & Environment

Check if the implementation introduced any new config requirements:

- New environment variables referenced but not documented
- New config files mentioned in code but not created
- Database migrations created but not documented in README/docs

```
Grep in CHANGED_FILES: process\.env\.|os\.Getenv\(|os\.environ|env\(|getenv\(|config\(
```

Cross-reference with `.env.example`, `.env.local`, README, or docs to ensure they're documented.

### 3.4 DESCRIPTION.md Sync

Check if `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md` reflects the current state:

- New dependencies/libraries added during implementation → should be listed
- Architecture changes → should be reflected
- New integrations → should be documented

---

## Step 4: Verification Report

### 4.1 Display Results

```
## Verification Report

### Task Completion: 7/8 (87%)
| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Create user model | ✅ Complete | |
| 2 | Add registration endpoint | ✅ Complete | |
| 3 | Add password reset | ⚠️ Partial | Missing: email sending |
| 4 | Add JWT auth middleware | ✅ Complete | |
| 5 | Add rate limiting | ✅ Complete | |
| 6 | Add input validation | ✅ Complete | |
| 7 | Add error handling | ✅ Complete | |
| 8 | Update API docs | ❌ Not found | No changes in docs/ |

### Code Quality
- Build: ✅ Passes
- Tests: ✅ 42 passed, 0 failed
- Lint: ⚠️ 2 warnings in src/api/auth/reset.ts

### Issues Found
1. **Task #3 incomplete** — Password reset endpoint created but email sending not implemented (SendGrid integration missing)
2. **Task #8 not done** — API documentation not updated despite plan requirement
3. **2 TODOs found** — src/services/auth.ts:45, src/middleware/rate-limit.ts:12
4. **New env var undocumented** — `SENDGRID_API_KEY` referenced but not in .env.example

### No Issues
- All imports resolved
- No unused dependencies
- DESCRIPTION.md up to date
- No leftover debug logs
```

### 4.2 Determine Overall Status

- **All Green** — everything verified, no issues
- **Minor Issues** — small gaps that can be fixed quickly
- **Significant Gaps** — tasks missing or partially done, needs re-implementation

### 4.3 Action on Issues

If issues were found:

```
AskUserQuestion: Verification found issues. What should we do?

Options:
1. Fix now (recommended) — Use /aif-fix to address all issues
2. Fix critical only — Use /aif-fix for incomplete tasks, skip warnings
3. Fix directly here — Address issues in this session without /aif-fix
4. Accept as-is — Mark everything as done, move on
```

**If "Fix now" or "Fix critical only":**
- First suggest using `/aif-fix` and pass a concise issue summary as argument
- Example:
  - `/aif-fix complete Task #3 password reset email flow, implement Task #8 docs update, remove TODOs in src/services/auth.ts and src/middleware/rate-limit.ts, document SENDGRID_API_KEY in .env.example`
- If user agrees, proceed via `/aif-fix`
- If user declines `/aif-fix`, continue with direct implementation in this session
- For each incomplete/partial task — implement the missing pieces (follow the same implementation rules as `/aif-implement`)
- For TODOs/debug artifacts — clean them up
- For undocumented config — update `.env.example` and docs
- After fixing, re-run the relevant verification checks to confirm

**If "Accept as-is":**
- Note the accepted issues in the plan file as a comment
- Continue to Step 5

---

## Step 5: Suggest Follow-Up Skills

After verification is complete, suggest next steps based on result:

- If unresolved issues remain (accepted or deferred), suggest `/aif-fix` first
- If all green, suggest security/review/commit flow

```
## Verification Complete

Suggested next steps:

1. 🛠️ /aif-fix [issue summary] — Fix remaining verification issues
2. 🔒 /aif-security-checklist — Run security audit on the new code
3. 👀 /aif-review — Code review of the implementation
4. 💾 /aif-commit — Commit the changes

Which would you like to run? (or skip all)
```

```
AskUserQuestion: Run additional checks?

Options:
1. Fix issues — Run /aif-fix with verification findings
2. Security check — Run /aif-security-checklist on changed files
3. Code review — Run /aif-review on the implementation
4. Both — Run security check, then code review
5. Skip — Proceed to commit
```

**If fix issues selected** → suggest invoking `/aif-fix <issue summary>`
**If security check selected** → suggest invoking `/aif-security-checklist`
**If code review selected** → suggest invoking `/aif-review`
**If both** → suggest security first, then review
**If skip** → suggest `/aif-commit`

### Context Cleanup

Context is heavy after verification. All results are saved — suggest freeing space:

```
AskUserQuestion: Free up context before continuing?

Options:
1. /clear — Full reset (recommended)
2. /compact — Compress history
3. Continue as is
```

---

## Strict Mode

When invoked with `--strict`:

```
/aif-verify --strict
```

- **All tasks must be COMPLETE** — no partial or skipped allowed
- **Build must pass** — fail verification if build fails
- **Tests must pass** — fail verification if any test fails (tests are required in strict mode)
- **Lint must pass** — zero warnings, zero errors
- **No TODOs/FIXMEs** in changed files
- **No undocumented environment variables**

Strict mode is recommended before merging to main or creating a pull request.

---

## Usage

### After implement (suggested automatically)
```
/aif-verify
```

### Strict mode before merge
```
/aif-verify --strict
```

### Standalone (no plan, verify branch diff)
```
/aif-verify
→ No plan found → verify branch diff against main
```
